Copy code
Point::Point(Point const &src) {
    std::cout << "Point Copy constructor called" << std::endl;
    *this = src; // This is problematic.
    return;
}
Issues:
Self-assignment: Using *this = src; in the copy constructor is not a good practice. This will invoke the copy assignment operator, which may lead to unintended consequences, especially if the assignment operator modifies the current object or uses a resource that has been freed.
Fix:
Instead of using the assignment operator, you should initialize the member variables directly from the src object. Here's a corrected version:

cpp
Copy code
Point::Point(Point const &src) {
    std::cout << "Point Copy constructor called" << std::endl;
    // Initialize member variables directly
    this->x = src.x; // Assuming x and y are member variables of Point
    this->y = src.y; // Assuming y is a member variable of Point
}
