# C++ Module 02

This module focuses on ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and the Orthodox Canonical class form in C++. You will build a fixed-point number class and expand it with arithmetic operations, comparisons, and geometric usage.

## 🛠️ Usage

For each exercise, navigate to its folder, compile, and run:

📂 ex00

```bash
cd ex00
make
./fixed
```

📂 ex01

```bash
cd ex01
make
./fixedUseful
```

📂 ex02

```bash
cd ex02
make
./fixedOperators
```

📂 ex03

```bash
cd ex03
make
./bsp
```


## 📝 Exercise Descriptions
ex00 — My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form:
Build a Fixed class with raw value handling, canonical form methods, and debug messages.

ex01 — Towards a More Useful Fixed-Point Number Class:
Add int and float constructors, conversions, and an insertion (<<) operator.

ex02 — Now We’re Talking:
Add comparison, arithmetic, increment/decrement operators, plus static min/max functions.

ex03 — BSP:
Use the Fixed class in geometric computations to check if a point is inside a triangle.
